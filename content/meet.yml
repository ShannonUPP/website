      bio: >-
           While Brian has spent most of his career in startups and leading large tech companies, he realized most of
           the companies were focused on capturing user's data and providing very little to the users in return.
           A Mainer through and through, you'd be as likely find him changing someone's tire on the side of the road
           for them as you would staying up all night coding.

      title: CTO + Founder
      bio: >-
           Millennial and looks like it (aka belongs in a ’00s pop punk band). Annoyingly good at building things, a tad
           crazy, and maybe a bit too type-a. Lover of coffee, hater of schedules; his sanity tied to dingy bars. We
           can’t get him to stop talking about real transparency and no, not that bs buzzword thrown around Silicon Valley.
