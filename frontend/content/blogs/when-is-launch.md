In this article, you will find out more about our journey, what our game plan is, and how you can help us reach our goal
of getting all users paid their fair share quicker.

We have broken our journey in 3 stages, below you will find detailed information for each of them:

1. **Getting 10,000 email sign ups.**  
   We need 10,000 email sign ups to make sure everyone gets their fair share. Also, the more people sign up, the greater
   the pay is!

2. **Getting 5,000 app installs.**  
   We will notify everyone signed up when we launch our private Beta. At this stage, we need your input. We’re building
   this for you.

3. **Payday.**  
   When enough people have installed the app (>5,000), we can start getting you paid. Start taking back control, start
   making money!

## 01: Getting 10,000 email sign ups

Ok, so at this stage all that we need is your email address so we can get you notified when we launch!

*Stage 1: 10,000 Sign ups*

### What can you do to help?

Simply go to [mytiki.com](https://mytiki.com/#signup) and enter your email! That’s all!

**If you want to go even a step further**, you can always share that same webpage with all your friends, family and
social media (social links at the bottom of the page — we’ve got a lot of these!)

## 02: Getting 5,000 app installs

Alright, now you have signed up with your email, you will get notified when our Beta is released, and take part of
shaping it all up (which means telling us what features you’d like to see, which of your accounts you’d like to link,
etc.)

### Why we need 5,000 sign ups?

Your data is only valuable if it is a part of a larger pool (and on its own, your anonymized data is encrypted, and not
visible to anyone anyway).

### What can you do to help?

Give us all thoughts and opinions about what you’d like to see in the product. We **love** honest opinions- tell us what
you don’t like, as well as what you like about it! Don’t be afraid to contact us early (even may be now?) with thoughts
on it all — our team (and that is, Mike, Shane, Anna) are all ears and reachable pretty much all the time
on [Telegram](https://t.me/mytikiapp), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be)
, [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA66Eq2VHecpcCd-cu-dziozMRSH3EuQdcZJNyMOYNi5EhC0coWtjWzKQ1dDKEjMqhkP), and, of
course, social media. Can’t wait to chat!

**If you want to the extra mile…** again, sharing the app with your friends would make a huge difference for us!

## 03: Payday

The best part!

Once we have enough people using the app, we can start getting you paid!

This means getting the full set of anonymized data sold to companies, so that you can start earning money.

Of course, it is up to you to decide if you want to sell your data at all, or how much of it!

Generally, we plan to get you remunerated proportionally for your data — so the more data you share, the more you will
get paid. See [our FAQs](https://mytiki.com/blog/faq) for how this works!

### What can you do to help?

At this stage — you can help in two ways:

1. Keep giving us feedback
2. Share TIKI with the world — the more people use TIKI, the more everyone gets paid!

That’s it — once we have reached this stage, we will only keep paying you, and hopefully, bigger and bigger amounts, as
our user base grows.

This way, and only this way, we can get the internet back. And we believe by creating
a [“data market”, we will truly make the internet a better place for everyone](https://mytiki.com/blog/data-market-fix-internet)
.

**A place for the people, created by the people.**
