Hey y’all,

It’s been a while since we last updated you all, and this is entirely on us.

The TIKI movement has been growing extremely fast (50,000 sign-ups!), and we had to focus on managing all this
excitement. As a small team, this is not always easy, and we had to re-focus and re-organize our plans a bit.

At the end of March, we released a basic version of the app that only includes login and referrals. We’ve only made it
this far because we only have Mike to work on it. Mike is our only engineer and CEO of the company (imagine how hard he
works!).

## We have to get to 100k sign-ups so that we can grow the engineering team

To get the app built quickly, we need to get more engineers on board. To do this, we have to get investment (and here
is [how](https://mytiki.com/blog/executive-summary-0421)). To get investment, we need to get to **100,000 users signed
up**.

Chicken and egg situation, right?

The good news is, you can totally help! As we have 50k people on board now, we only need each of you to invite **just
one more person to get to our goal.** When we do this, we’ll be able to raise some money, and hire a whole engineering
team and build TIKI as good as it can be… and then, the world (and the internet) is ours to take!

So help Mike get some sleep by [inviting just 1 person to sign up for TIKI](http://www.mytiki.com/#signup).

All yours,  
**the TIKI team**
