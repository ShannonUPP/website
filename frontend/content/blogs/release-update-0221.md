### It is St Valentine’s weekend, and we cannot believe how much love we got from you.

Firstly, we now have more than **7,000 sign ups!** (earlier this week we were at 5k, the jump to 7k happened sooo
quickly).

This means we are 70% there on our [10,000 sign ups goal](https://mytiki.com/blog/when-is-launch).

### For those of you who just joined the TIKI community (our most recent 3,000 members)… Welcome, we are so glad to have you!

Second reason to love you — our [user feedback channel](https://feedback.mytiki.com/) is now full of upvotes, comments
and suggestions from you, the TIKI community. Thank you so much, keep it coming. We are watching, and listening!

**[I’ll give feedback](https://feedback.mytiki.com/)**

## So where is TIKI right now?

We have taken a different approach to building TIKI. We start by asking **YOU** about what you want to see in the app.
Why? Because you are more important than a process.

TIKI is built for the users, by the users. We are user-centric, and we celebrate each comment or piece of feedback that
we receive.

And it all starts from there. We can lock Mike in a room for a few weeks, and get an app out that doesn’t work for you,
or we can ASK YOU what you’d like to see in the app.

Once we have enough information about what users want (we are hoping that a substantial part of the first 10,000 will
tell us), we are ready to release the app to the world.

## When are we launching?

### The reality is, we need to get to 10,000 sign ups before you can start selling your data.

Individually our data is not worth very much, but when we mix together yours, mine, and 9,998 others, it becomes quite
powerful.

The more people that sign up, the more valuable all of our data is worth. Together, we can take back our data.

## How can you help?

By sharing TIKI with friends and giving us feedback, you can help us get to 10,000 sign ups quicker and get you paid!

You can also keep [giving us your feedback](https://feedback.mytiki.com/), thoughts, comments, opinions…. This will help
a lot.

Sharing your love,  
All the best,  
**Mike, Anna, Shane, and Barry**
