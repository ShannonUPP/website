Exciting times! [TIKI](https://mytiki.com/) went out of stealth mode and we embarked on our core mission empowering
people to take back control of their data!

But how can we show who we truly are?

The answer is: **branding**. One of the first projects I got involved with upon joining TIKI was to create branding that
reflects our values as a company.

For anyone who’s come across the [lean startup concept](http://theleanstartup.com/#principles), you will know that, at
an early stage of a startup, it is important to be lean and do things in an agile and time-efficient way. Our first
branding attempt followed that principle — it took us less than a week, from start to finish!

You may be wondering — what exactly is *branding* and why is it important at all? Fear not, wanderer, the truth will be
revealed very shortly…

### What is branding?

Many people think that their logo is their brand. While this is an understandable assumption to make, the truth is that
your brand is so much more than that. Your brand is a tightly-knit web of components and “touch-points” that represent
your company in a visual way, but also through language and behaviour.

> > **Your brand is not your logo.**

A brand identity consists of a few key components that will shape the brand experience:

1. Brand values
2. Logotype & logo
3. Colour palette
4. Typography
5. Colours
6. Graphic elements & imagery
7. Tone of voice

The above components are usually documented and “packed” neatly in a document called **brand guidelines** by design
agencies commissioned to do the branding.

### Why is branding important?

There are numerous resources out there that talk about how a company’s brand can make it or break it.

Take [Apple](https://www.wired.com/2002/12/apple-its-all-about-the-brand/).
Take [Nike](https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/nike-branding-strategy/).
Take [Coca-cola](https://www.businessinsider.com/strategies-coca-cola-used-to-become-an-iconic-brand-2016-2?r=US&IR=T).

Take many other brands that have remained a recognisable “brand” generation after a generation. What is the single thing
they have in common?

CONSISTENCY.

The one key secret to creating and keeping a great brand identity through the the various stages of a business is
consistency. This means having a unified brand voice and vision, and communicating these through the various channels
the brand speaks from. To create your brand voice, and the visual representation of your brand, you first need to define
your **brand values**.

The first step to a consistent brand identity is to define your brand’s values.

> > **Consistency is the №1 secret** for creating a successful brand identity.

For us at TIKI it was very important to define our brand values early on. We wanted the world to know what we stand for.
From day 1.

With each team member brainstorming separately, we defined our three core brand values — *trust*, *transparency* and *
user focus*.

> > TIKI’s brand values — we are transparent, we care about the users first and foremost, and we can be trusted.

So how can you make your first step towards creating the successful brand identity of your startup? Here are the lessons
that we learned that may help you along the way.

## Lesson 1. Be true to who you are

… as a business, as well as founders.

All that we knew about our brand when we started the exercise is that we didn’t want follow corporate identity values,
nor to behave or look like a corporate.

![Color Wheels & Theory](/blog-images/1*owTAHpFtUmmQCojm-9wR0Q.png)

TIKI is human, TIKI is trust-worthy, in many ways it had to behave like a person, and not like a (large) organisation.

However, our initial approach was done in a not-so-human way. Going through colour theory analysis and justification, we
tried to say to ourselves “blue colour stands for trust, let’s use blue colour”. This logical approach did not quite
worked for what we thought TIKI stood for…

Thankfully, what we did next, worked.

## Lesson 2. Look for inspiration

Back to the drawing board.

As deciding on a colour didn’t feel right, we looked elsewhere for inspiration.

We thought harder about our brand values, that **user focus** also means **being human**, and **being trusted** also
means **being playful and not taking yourself too seriously**.

At this point, somehow the whole narrative started to take shape. Finding relevant examples from other personable
brands (from other markets, even), I put together rough ideas on a notepad and did some quick colour mock-ups. There you
go! We began to see what TIKI really stands for!

## Lesson 3. Everyone should take part

All of us working together helped to speed up the process and get to a decision quicker. Everyone had their own ideas,
so it was important to communicate and unify them into one.

After (just) a couple of meetings, throwing ideas backwards and forwards, we came up with the winning approach.

By collating it all together, iterating when necessary and putting the final touches to it, I could facilitate that
vision and present it back to the team.

> > Especially in a startup, it is important that the majority, if not all, of your team is on board with the brand you 
> > are creating together.

My advice to you, the early stage brand-builder master, is — get everyone from your team on the same page, as early as
possible. Communicate between yourselves **what** you think your business brand values are, and **how** you see what
these values look, sound and feel like. Do this as early as possible in the process, and as many times as needed.

You are in this journey together, and your brand is what is going to represent all of you to the external world.

## Lesson 4: Iterate

In the process of deciding on a branding route, we went through various options and ideas, eventually narrowing down
options and agreeing on a single route forward.

![Just some of the ideas we went through while deciding on a final approach](/blog-images/1*ptc9pV0SCLowmM2WLw6Q_w.png)

It is important to initially explore multiple routes. This can help you define what works, and what doesn’t.

And also, it always feels good to turn your thoughts into real thing on a piece of paper (or, in our case, collaborative
doc!). *Tip*: [Figma](http://www.figma.com/) is a great design tool that helps us collaborate.

## Lesson 5: Launch now. Your brand will keep evolving

Your brand will be like a bowl of Jell-O— you know what it is, you know how it tastes and looks like, but its shape will
change, twist and adapt according to the many twists and turns of the journey called Startup life.

While consistency is super important, you will still have some room to manoeuvre with your brand — do it wisely, and not
without a reason. Always go back to your **brand values** — they will define your brand voice and vision along the
journey.

> > If there is one rule to follow to keeping your brand consistent along the journey, it is: **be true to your brand 
> > values.**

Because it is your brand that will speak to the users on your behalf, and tell them the honest story you wish to tell
them in person.

And in the case of TIKI’s brand — we are ready to tell our story to the world.
