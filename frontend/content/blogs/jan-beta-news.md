This is it! The end of January is here, and we have news for you.

Our [user feedback channel](https://feedback.mytiki.com) is now live and ready to get your thoughts, opinions, wishes,
or anything TIKI related that you’d like to share with us.

## Why we need your thoughts

We are building TIKI differently than other companies. Most new companies first build their apps, then ask for feedback.

At TIKI, we have taken a different approach. We start by asking YOU about what you want to see in the app. Why? Because
you are more important than a process.

TIKI is built for the users, by the users. We are user centric, and we celebrate each comment or piece of feedback that
we receive.

And it all starts from there. We can lock Mike in a room for a few weeks, and get an app out that doesn’t work for you,
or we can **ASK YOU** what you’d like to see in the app.

Once we have enough information about what users want (we are hoping that a substantial part of the first 10,000 will
tell us), we are ready to release the app to the world.

And this is what we mean by launching a Beta.

## Where we are right now

The reality is, we need to get to 10,000 sign ups before we can start selling your data. The reason is that a small
amount of data is not sellable. Your data, and my data, sold individually, is not valuable enough to companies to pay
for it. Our data is only important if it is all of us together.

The reality is, we need to get to [10,000](https://mytiki.com/blog/when-is-launch) sign ups before you can start selling
your data. Individually our data is not worth very much, but when we mix together yours, mine, and 9,998 others, it
becomes quite powerful. The more people that sign up, the more valuable all of our data is worth. Together, we can take
back our data.

Right now, we have more than 3,500 sign ups! That’s a lot, given the fact that we only started to spread the word about
TIKI less than a month ago. But we’re not at the 10,000 mark yet. The good news is, you can help. If you
share [TIKI](http://www.mytiki.com/) with only 3 of your friends and they all sign up, this will make a big difference.
Because if everyone else reading this email does the same, we’ll reach 10,000 in an instant!

This will mean we can start getting you paid for your data!

## What’s next

Ok, I am sure you are wondering what we are doing next in order to launch TIKI. Rest assured, we’ve got you covered.

Once we have [your feedback](http://feedback.mytiki.com/) today, here what we’ll be working on next, most likely in that
order:

1. Finish design (stage 1) based on feedback

2. Sign up & Invite a friend functionalities

3. Ability to link an account to your
   profile ([let us know which is your most pressing choice!](http://feedback.mytiki.com/))

4. Dashboard to control your data and more accounts to be linked

5. Payment features

By sharing TIKI with friends and giving us feedback, you can help us get to step 5 quicker and get you paid!

And of course, we would love you to join our community channels — [Telegram](https://t.me/mytikiapp)
, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be)
, [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA66Eq2VHecpcCd-cu-dziozMRSH3EuQdcZJNyMOYNi5EhC0coWtjWzKQ1dDKEjMqhkP). There you
can get live answers from the members of the team — each of them is constantly keeping an eye on the community chat!

So if you ever want to chat to TIKI, we’re there for you — ready, and looking forward to changing the world together.
Together, we can fix the internet!

All the best,  
**Mike, Anna, Shane, and Barry**
