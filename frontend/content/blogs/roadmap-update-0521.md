Time is flying like crazy here at TIKI, and with another week and 66k+ total people signed up, the time has come to
update you on our product roadmap and what we’re building right now.

## What has been released?

## What’s next?

We‘ve now started to work on the core features of the TIKI app, starting with features focused on privacy which will
allow you to have more visibility of your online data and make informed decisions on who else can see it.

### The next feature we will release is the ability to [link your Gmail account](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/Link-Gmail-account-9fcff4e017f44cfbb238e1a5b128b201) and [see what data Gmail holds on you](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/List-what-Gmail-holds-on-you-37f0db9aebab43cf8e35da91083971a8).

We have listed this, and other features we’re currently building
in [our detailed Product Roadmap](http://www.mytiki.com/roadmap), which is updated live so we can keep you all updated
as we progress.

Here are the 3 top features we’re releasing in the next month:

1. Link your Gmail and see what data it holds on
   you ([info](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/List-what-Gmail-holds-on-you-37f0db9aebab43cf8e35da91083971a8))

2. Unsubscribe from SPAM ([info](https://www.notion.so/mytiki/Unsubscribe-from-SPAM-1f177a0ea0ea4d4e8ddc8a766ee50731))

## Our launch, explained

I’ve been asked about why we released a super early version of the app, and are adding each app’s core feature one by
one, instead of doing a full blast big release. In software development, this is called “soft launch”.

When building a software product every single functionality is important. To have every bit to be as good as it can be,
testing early for bugs is key. This is why we release it in stages. So that we can make sure that every bit of the app
is as good as it can be.

Plus, we’re a super small team so we don’t have the resources to hire a large coding team. right now. The only way to
speed up the process is to get more people to sign up so we can get investment and grow the dev team quicker (as
described in our [last product update](https://mytiki.com/blog/release-update-0421))!

**You can always help us get there quicker by [sharing TIKI with your friends](http://www.mytiki.com/#signup)** *(tip:
use the referral code in the app to get some cash for it).*

## Follow our future progress

As we always aim to be as transparent as possible, we have 3 website channels in total for you to see what we’re
building now and in the future. Each of them serves a different purpose, and has different level of view of our product
development cycle — from top view, to a super detail view at a technical level.

### Our 3 channels to see all product development:

1. **[Feedback & feature requests](https://feedback.mytiki.com/)**— easily leave comment on our feedback
   channel *[Big picture view]

As for the big picture of where we are going, check Mike’s article here on what our grand vision is, an expect more
updates and prototypes soon.

We’re working hard to make our product vision a reality so that you can finally get your data back. Because it’s YOUR
data. It must be YOUR decision on what to do with it.

All yours,  
**Anna and the TIKI team**
