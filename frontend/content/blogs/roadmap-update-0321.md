Hello everyone! It’s happening. We are launching TIKI in the next few days, and today we’d like to share what our
product roadmap will look like. Our roadmap is based on [your feedback](https://feedback.mytiki.com/), which has been
amazing and super helpful — [keep feeding it back in](https://feedback.mytiki.com/), so we know what you’d like!

In this article, we have put the ink down to the virtual paper, so that you all have a clear and very transparent view
of what our plans are.

## Release 1.0: Launch release

You might already know that TIKI’s 1st release is scheduled for the week commencing 22 Mar 2021*. This release will be
available **to signed up users only** (don’t’ worry, you can still sign up on [www.mytiki.com](www.mytiki.com) to be
part of it). We’ll let all our users know (via email or text) how to download the app.

TIKI’s Release 1.0 will consist of **Sign up and referral functionality**.  
[Here is the full prototype of what we’re releasing at launch.](https://mytiki.invisionapp.com/console/share/TJ2C6BIRCN)

### Sign up & referral functionality

Creating secure sign up, login and referral functionality is an important task. We wanted to make sure this is done in
the most secure way possible, and we focused on these functionalities for release 1.0:

1. **Ability to create an account:** We are introducing a simple email-only solution to both login and sign up. This
   will improve the user experience, while maintaining high security.

2. **Security keys:** when you first sign up, you’ll be able to given your TIKI secure keys. We highly recommend you
   save these for when you change your device or uninstall the TIKI app.

3. **Bouncer service:** Instead of a traditional authentication/authorization system we built a custom “bouncer”
   service. We use one-time password links delivered over email to log users in. These passwords are exchanged for
   short-lived anonymous JWTs. Passwords are the worst (
   see [https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI](https://youtu.be/opRMrEfAIiI)), so we don’t use them or even store your email.

4. **Blockchain:** We’re working towards a revolutionary new type of blockchain. For perspective, the most distributed
   chain in the world has <40k nodes. We’ve already got 25k users… It’s going to a few months for this new type of chain
   to be ready. In the meantime were rolling out a single source of truth (SSOT) chain with end-to-end encryption E2E.

5. **Referral system:** You asked, we delivered. After release 1.0, you’ll be able to share TIKI with friends and get
   remunerated after they sign up to TIKI. Your payout will be possible after we add the ability to link a payment
   method to TIKI.

Don’t forget that our data is so much more valuable if we work together and invite our friends and family, so keep
sharing TIKI with the world using the sharing functionality in the TIKI app!

## Product roadmap

What we are aiming to do after the first release is have super frequent releases — (pretty much) **weekly releases
throughout April and May.**

In each of these releases, we’ll improve or add a new functionality, so that every time there is an update, you come
back to TIKI to discover a new (and cool) feature addition.

> > We’re aiming to do (pretty much) weekly new releases of the TIKI app throughout April and May.

Below is our current plan for the next 3 months (as of 21st March).

*TIKI Product Roadmap: Apr-Jun*  

We are aiming to get all of these features released quicker, but we’d rather promise you a slower timeline — we simply
don’t want to disappoint you and be late with our delivery!

We are, of course, still collecting your feedback and ideas on [our feedback channel](https://feedback.mytiki.com/), and
regularly updating the roadmap on there. Stay tuned-the future is exciting!

Together, we can take back control of our data!
