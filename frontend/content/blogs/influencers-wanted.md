As we gear up for the full TIKI app launch (so exciting!), we’re partnering with influencers to help us get the word
out. These paid partnerships will steer followers to [mytiki.com](https://mytiki.com/#signup) to sign up to be notified
when the app is officially available for download.

## Who we’re looking for:

We’re looking for influencers on TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram who share our mission. Perhaps you create content on
data privacy, data rights, cyber security, or technology — or maybe you typically post about other topics but recognize
the importance of data rights and believe your audience does, too.

The goal: Encouraging your followers to go to mytiki.com and sign up. How you do this is mostly up to you — as the
content creator, you’ll have creative freedom, although we’ll be here should you need assistance with messaging or
visuals. The content can be stand alone or part of a longer video. Partnerships are paid and can be flat rate or on a
pay-per-signup basis via an affiliate link. We’ll hash out the details based on what makes sense for you and your brand.

### FMI:

Here’s a kit with additional info: [bit.ly/TIKIMediaKit](https://bit.ly/TIKIMediaKit).  
Reach out any time to Shane ([shane@mytiki.com](mailto:shane@mytiki.com)) or
Shannon ([shannon@mytiki.com](shannon@mytiki.com)) for more info or to join us as an influencer!

## About us:

We believe users have a right to see the data they share, control the sharing of their data, and be compensated for
their data when and if they CHOOSE to share it. The TIKI app makes this all possible, allowing all of us to take control
of our data. Awesome, right?

![TIKI team](/blog-images/1*Rqpfp7JPokgvE5Sa48TFMQ.jpg)
*TIKI is for users and we want you to know everyone
involved. [More about the TIKI team here](https://mytiki.com/blog/team).*

TIKI makes it possible for each of us to take control of our online data. Right now, big corporations make hefty profits
by selling that data (that’s hardly a secret these days, but you might be surprised by HOW MUCH information those
companies have about who you are, where you go, what you buy, your politics, your eating habits, who you hang out with,
and what riles you up — and that’s just the surface).

The thing is, your data belongs to you. Not to Google. Not to Facebook. Not to Amazon. If you’re happy to share it with
them or any other entity, great. But YOU should be able to decide.

With TIKI, users can choose to share — or not share — whatever data they’re comfortable with. Maybe you’re an open book.
Maybe you’ll take your secrets to the grave. Maybe you’re somewhere in the middle. Wherever you stand, YOU have the
right to choose. That’s why TIKI is totally transparent. You can see, control, and change what you share.

data](/blog-images/0*nNECn4dxVScatmDi.png)

And TIKI enables small and medium-sized businesses to affordably access data that helps them grow and improve their
businesses. When they pay for data, you get paid. Because why should big companies make money off of our data?

If you want more background and “where we’re coming from,” read
this [executive summary](https://mytiki.com/blog/executive-summary-0421). Our co-founder, Mike, does an awesome job
outlining WHY having control of our data is so important, and TIKI’s role in making that idea a reality.
