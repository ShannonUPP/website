Most of you reading this are probably aware that, since launching TIKI, our first goal has always been to signup 10,000
users for the launch of our exclusive beta.

We had to get to a community of 10k signed up users before we could start selling your data.

That’s because your data, and my data, sold individually is not valuable enough — the more people take part, the more
valuable the data is!

**We are stronger together.**

## We did it!

Thanks to all of you who signed up to join TIKI’s revolution, we accomplished our first goal. We reached 10,000 sign
ups, and this means we can move on to step 2 — building the TIKI app and getting you paid.

Remember, the more people join, the more your data will earn.

## Next — our release schedule

At this point, you might be wondering — “but when would I get a chance to install the TIKI app, link my accounts, and
start getting paid”?

Without further ado, TIKI’s team is excited to announce that we have a concrete timeline in place. As you can see from
Mike’s update [here](https://mytiki.com/blog/pre-seed-program), we have a goal to launch TIKI in March, and start
getting people paid shortly after. To start with, we’ll only release the app to signed up users so make sure to sign up
on [our website](http://www.mytiki.com/#signup) and get your friends to sign up, too.

> TIKI’s app will be released around the third week of March, and we aim to start getting people paid shortly after.

Our main milestones are, in the following order:

1. Launch TIKI’s mobile app — mid-March

2. Start getting people paid — we aim to do so by April

3. Getting people paid $10/month — spring/summer

## Our next goal — 100,000 sign ups!

Together, we managed to cross the first bridge, but this is only the beginning of TIKI’s journey. To get our movement to
really make a difference, and to get more value from our combined data, we need to grow our community bigger, and do it
fast. We need to get to 100k users, then 1 million users, then… who knows, at this point, we have really started to make
a positive change in the way the data system operates!

But let’s take it one step at a time. Our next focused goal is to **get 100,000 sign ups** by May.

And this will require even more energy, extra resources (there’s only that many hours in the week!) and most
importantly, getting more people to spread out the word about TIKI. That’s the main reason we went to get investment
from angel investors that we knew would fully support TIKI’s mission. As per usual, we have publicly written about it
all in Mike’s [short update](https://mytiki.com/blog/pre-seed-program) and
full [investor brief](https://mytiki.com/blog/investor-brief-0221).

> We need to get to 100,000 users, so that we can make our movement stronger, and more impactful.

*Our next goal — 100,000 users*  

## We need to keep growing to make our data more valuable and our movement more powerful

### How can you help?

Keep sharing TIKI with friends! If each of our 10k+ users shares TIKI with 3 friends, we will be 1/3rd of our way to the
next goal, in an instant! Remember, only signed up users will have a chance to download TIKI when we launch!

So please feel free to keep spreading the word — and who knows, {***spoiler alert***} there might also be a referral
system with rewards built in the app, who knows…

You can also keep [giving us your feedback](http://feedback.mytiki.com/), thoughts, comments, opinions…. This will help
a lot.
