Hello, TIKI tribe! The big day is here, the TIKI app has now launched!  
If you’re reading this, you are probably among the first to know about the launch, as you have signed up for TIKI early
on, and are mostly likely to be part of our community or follow us on social media.

We are so lucky to have you all, and we truly appreciate all your love! We know this moment has been long waited for by
many of you, and we cannot express enough how much your support means to us.

To make the best of our launch and genuinely get your feedback, we’ll share the release news in three stages:

1. **Our communities** ([Discord](https://discord.com/invite/evjYQq48Be), [Telegram](https://t.me/mytikiapp)
   , [Signal](https://signal.group/#CjQKIA66Eq2VHecpcCd-cu-dziozMRSH3EuQdcZJNyMOYNi5EhC0coWtjWzKQ1dDKEjMqhkP)). We’ll
   share TIKI with our communities, as we know their excitement to try and test TIKI as soon as possible!

2. **Our social media channels** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/my.tiki/)
   , [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mytikiapp/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/my_tiki_)
   , [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mytiki/)). We’ve had quite a lot of excitement from our social media
   followers, so we’ll make sure to share the app launch on social shortly after we’ve notified our community groups.

3. **All people that have signed up.** We’ll send a one-off email to everyone who’s signed up to TIKI
   via [our website](https://mytiki.com/).

## Our goal for release 1

In [our product roadmap article](https://mytiki.com/blog/roadmap-update-0321), you will find our more about what the
first release contains and what our future release plans are.

While we have revealed what’s upcoming over the next 3 months, we can change the priorities of each feature — it really
depends on [the feedback we receive from you](https://feedback.mytiki.com/). We will be making frequent releases, and
frequent feature additions, so you

The deciding factor on every single development that we do, is your feedback.

#### This is why your feedback is crucial to TIKI.

With the 1st release, we need you, the users, to test the app, and let us know about any bugs that you find or
improvements we can make. This will help us build **the TIKI world** that **YOU** want to see and experience.  
You can inform us about these on all our community groups, social media or email. You choose the format.

We’re here and listening to your feedback. And improving TIKI with an almost superhero (Marvel OR DC — we don’t
discriminate!) speed.

### Device compatibility

OK, now you know that your testing skills are super valuable to us, let’s answer the most important question — which OS
is TIKI compatible with?

#### TIKI is available for both iOS and Android.

2. Click on the link called “Download it on Google Play”

3. **Install** TIKI Early Access app on Google Play.

public App Store**, so you won’t find TIKI in your store app. Follow the installation steps below:

without you! Our ability to take back control of our data is much more powerful when we work together, so please
keep [spreading the word about TIKI](http://www.mytiki.com/medium)!
