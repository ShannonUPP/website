User data is broken. Trust is at an all-time low, privacy is non-existent, and people are pissed. How data is collected, shared, and used is changing fast. Major markets like the $80B/yr. mobile digital advertising market, have been up-ended.  

The solution doesnâ€™t have to be complex (at least conceptually ðŸ˜‰), enable users to easily make decisions about their own data. With TIKI 1) see what data companies collect on you. 2) Control your privacy from one app, not dozens with confusing setting screens. 3) Monetize your data; get paid to share your data with the companies you choose.  

Businesses, particularly digital-first businesses rely on data, and it's getting scarce. A user data market not only fills the need for traditional marketing data, but it adds a level of depth and breadth previously unobtainable. For example, Disney would pay a lot for Netflixâ€™s user watch history. Netflix will never sell it to them but as users, we don't care.  

TIKIâ€™s business model is a true broker, it does not buy and resell data, instead, the buyer is charged an additional transaction fee. This means users receive 100% of their data revenue and TIKI is incentivized to get them the most possible.  

TIKI is built on 3 pillars, user-centricity, trust, and transparency. With each new user, all of our data is worth a little more. With each new user, we all gain a little more power over our data. Itâ€™s resonating, before anything else, we went to the users. Starting Jan. 2021, 4,000 users registered for our beta. At an avg. CAC of $0.60, weâ€™re on track for 10,000 by end of Feb. â€™21. The next step is to deliver the MVP and start bringing value to a passionate user community.  

In parallel with delivering the MVP, we have a repeatable user acquisition program and will look to scale it 10x to 100k users in the next 3 months through a small but strategic investment.
