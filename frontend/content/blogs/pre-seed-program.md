*The information below assumes you have read our [Investor Brief](https://mytiki.com/blog/investor-brief-0221).*

## Purpose

We’re adding a small amount of capital specifically to scale up our user acquisition program in parallel to our current
MVP efforts. This enables us to rapidly grow the TIKI user base 10x (10k to 100k) via proven methods. Why? The more
users, the more valuable everyone’s data is. It’s a bit like the snowball effect. It takes activation energy, or you
might hear us use the phrase “escape gravity.”

---

As investors, you’re acutely dialed into questions like, who’s going to buy the data? Why they’re going to buy it? For
how much? I promise we’re not dodging them! Instead, together, let’s look at it as future TIKI users.

First, we’ve got to get everyone we can aboard. Individually, we have very little power; on its own, our data is worth
very little. However, add 100k friends, and now we’ve got something.

Second, we need a safe, transparent, and easy-to-use way to see, control, and monetize our data. TIKI needs to deliver a
world-class product built for users, by users. While the minimum viable product (MVP) scope will be narrow to begin, it
must be excellent in quality and bring real value. This context requires signing up early adopter businesses to buy data
because users **want** to sell their data.

---

Every business I’ve ever talked to, and I’d bet every you’ve ever talked to, wants data, particularly user data. The
demand is there, and the supply is becoming increasingly scarce. Following user acquisition and MVP success, maximizing
user data revenue becomes an effort in developing value propositions, defining use cases, and B2B inbound marketing.

At this stage, we’re focused on delivering massive value, first to users, then to businesses. As long as we stay
committed to that, revenue will follow. Growth will accelerate.

## Raise — $100k

Financial Instrument — SAFE note, 20% discount.  
Closed — $175k  
Runway — 3 months  

## Success Criteria

Success looks like tens of thousands of TIKI users taking back control of their data, getting paid for their data.

### KPI — 100,000 users

Milestones:

- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch.  
  Target: 3/15  
  
- Users can see their data, control their data, and get paid for their data.  
  Target: 3/31  
  
- A typical user makes $10/mth.  
  Target 4/30  

### User Acquisition Plan

Financial resources will be almost entirely focused on scaling user acquisition incrementally each month through proven
and repeatable processes. See the chart below for specifics.

### MVP Plan

We are currently collecting user feedback ([feedback.mytiki.com](https://feedback.mytiki.com)) on MVP features and will
look to lock the initial scope by the end of the month.

The remaining critical decision is which data integrations to support first. We aim to strike a balance between richness
of data, scarcity of data, and user sensitivity. For example, most social media data, while voluminous, is public and
available. Or that users are less willing to link their bank account than an Amazon account.

First mobile app downloads are expected in mid-March, with the ability to begin selling your data by the end of March.
One of the driving factors to keeping this round small and fast is our team needs to be building, not consumed by
raising capital.

## What happens after?

With the product live, TIKI will be helping tens of thousands of users take back control of their data. The following
steps will be to a) drive growth to 1M users. Likely through additional investment and b) increase the average data
revenue per user. When we sign up more businesses and define more cases, we generate more revenue for users.
