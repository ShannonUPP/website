Tiki is committed to protecting and preserving your privacy. 

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data we receive from the use 
of mytiki.com ("Site").

Our Site does not collect any personal data except contact information if you choose to provide it. We do not share 
any personal data.

For those unfamiliar with the term personal data, here is the official legal 
[definition](https://gdpr.eu/eu-gdpr-personal-data/). In layman's terms, it's any data that can be used to identify 
you either directly or indirectly—for example, an email address or a name.

By using this Site, you consent to the privacy practices and use of data that you provide us in accordance with this 
Privacy Policy. We do update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review this Privacy Policy regularly. 
If we materially alter our Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting a notice on our Site and, 
if applicable, using the contact information you provided. Your continued use of the Site will be deemed your agreement 
that your data may be used in accordance with the new policy. If you do not agree with the changes, then you should 
stop using the Site, and you should notify us that you do not want your information used in accordance with the changes.

Unlike most sites, we do not use cookies. Hence, no annoying popups and, more importantly, no creepy tracking of you.

This Site collects three types of data, the Contact Information you may provide, Anonymous Site Statistics, and 
Anonymous Infrastructure Metrics. When we say anonymous, we mean data that cannot be traced back to you—no personal 
data, no identifying characteristics of any kind. 

Contact Information: If you choose to provide your contact information (email address, phone number, or otherwise), 
it may only be used to deliver important Tiki updates such as feature previews, early beta invites, or other notable 
programs.

You have the right to access, update, or delete any of your personal data that we hold (Contact Information). If you 
would like to perform any of these actions, please contact us at [hello@mytiki.com](mailto:hello@mytiki.com). 

Anonymous Site Statistics: We collect the following [anonymous data](https://plausible.io/mytiki.com) to improve business operations, content, and 
performance of the Site.

Anonymous Infrastructure Metrics: We collect various anonymous data on the infrastructure powering the Site for 
security, maintenance, and improvements. Examples might be errors, load times, or cache hits—official [infrastructure 
configuration](https://github.com/tiki/website).

To ensure that your information is secure, we have put in place commercially suitable physical, electronic, and 
managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on our Site—specific [implementation 
details](https://github.com/tiki/website).

Nonetheless, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot 
guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically on our Site, and transmission of such data is therefore 
entirely at your own risk.

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our Site, please let us know as soon as possible at 
[hello@mytiki.com](mailto:hello@mytiki.com).
