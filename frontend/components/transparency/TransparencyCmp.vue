        Look, we’ve all been burned in the past, companies say they do one thing
        and then they do another. So instead not only are we open sourcing all
        of our code, and everything we do is transparent.

        We’ve been told by business leaders, investors, and experts its crazy,
        it will never work. “Everyone is just going to steal your hard work”.
        Maybe, but to us, trust is more important. We are accountable to you,
        not shareholders, businesses, or governments.

        We’re building TIKI for all of us to take back control of our data
        before its too late.
